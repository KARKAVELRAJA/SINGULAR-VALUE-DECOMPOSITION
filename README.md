# SINGULAR-VALUE-DECOMPOSITION

### IMPLEMENTION OF MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION MODEL

- The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix is a factorization of that matrix into three matrices
- It is a widely used technique to decompose a matrix into three component matrices, exposing many of the useful and interesting properties of the original matrix
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, the Matrix is created and the values are normalized
- Then, by using SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION MODEL, the normalized matrix is converted into three component matrices
